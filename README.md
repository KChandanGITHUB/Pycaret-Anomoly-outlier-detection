# Pycaret-Anomoly-outlier-detection

### Run the notebook to view the pycaret charts, it is not visible here.
This is an example of a notebook to demonstrate pycaret library for anomoly/outlier detection. In this example we will do some exploratory data analysis on the famous Iris dataset and then we build few models using pycaret for anomoly/outlier detection using supervised target feature.
PyCaret is a Python open source machine learning library designed to make performing standard tasks in a machine learning project easy.
It is a flexible and low-code library that enhances productivity thus saving time and effort.
PyCaret is a simple and easy-to-use machine learning library that enables us to perform ML tasks within minutes.
PyCaret library allows automating the machine learning steps such as data transformation, preparation, hyper-parameter tuning, and standard model comparisons.
